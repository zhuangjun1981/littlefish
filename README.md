# The Little Fish
This is a hobby project that explores how the intelligence of a neural network (i.e. a primitive brain) might be optimized (i.e. evolved) across generations without using back propagation and real-time feedback.

## Install:
```
>>> git clone https://github.com/zhuangjun1981/littlefish
>>> cd littlefish
>>> python setup.py install
```

## Run simulation
- first edit the `<repo directory>/littlefish/scripts/for_simulation/run_simulation.py`
  - modify `data_folder` to be a directory for saving simulation logs (can be several Gigs) 
  - if running from scratch, make sure `start_generation_ind = 0`
- Then run the script in python: `python <repo directory>/littlefish/scripts/for_simulation/run_simulation.py`

## View simulation
- First start simulation viewer:
```
python <repo directory>/littlefish/viewer/simulation_viewer.py
```
ÔºÅ[simulation viewer](littlefish/scripts/for_webpage/media/simulation_viewer.jpg)
- Then pick any `.hdf5` file saved in the simulation log folder.
